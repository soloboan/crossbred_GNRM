# Genomic relationship matrix (G) for crossbreds 
## varying scaling methods of G are implemented 
### script in infant stage

scaling G normally represented as [sum(2*p*q)] in vanRaden method 1

p - allele frequency
              
      1. allele frequency is computed from all dataset including purebreds and crossbreds
      2. allele frequency is computed within breeds
      3. using admiture information : purebreds(1), while crossbreds (ranges from 0-1)
